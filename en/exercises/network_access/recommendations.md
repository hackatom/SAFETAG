###### Recommendations for non-WPA networks
Transitioning to WPA networks with strong passwords, even for guest networks, is recommended.

MAC filtering and WEP provide no effective protection for a wifi network. Most wifi routers offer WPA encryption as an option, and if this is available it should be immediately implemented. Some older routers (and wifi devices) do not support WPA. It is highly recommended to upgrade immediately to hardware that supports WPA and to eliminate all WEP network access. Very few devices still functional do not support WPA2. As WPA3 becomes an option, upgrade to that.

###### Recommendations for WPA networks

WPS Pin entry should be disabled on the wireless router, or only enabled temporarily to add new devices to the network.

Choosing a strong WPA key is one of the most important steps toward defending an organization’s network perimeter from an adversary with the ability to spend some time in the vicinity of the offices. By extension, mitigating this vulnerability is critical to the protection of employees and partners (and confidential data) from the sort of persistent exposure that eventually brings down even the most well-secured information systems.

The WPA password should be long enough and complex enough to prevent both standard dictionary attacks and “brute-force attacks” in which clusters of powerful computers work in parallel to test every possible character combination. (We recommend 12 or more completely random characters or a passphrase that contains four or five—or more—relatively uncommon words.) The password should not contain common words, including number sequences, especially if they are related to the organization, its employees or its work.

A guest network, with no local network access and a distinct (possibly easier to communicate) password should be available if guests are ever given wifi access. Because passwords for guest networks inevitably end up being written on whiteboards, given to office visitors and emailed to partners, the guest password should also be changed periodically. This does not have to happen frequently, but anything less than three or four times per year may be unsafe.

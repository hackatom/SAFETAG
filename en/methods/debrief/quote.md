"*Most people demonstrate a cognitive response to digital threat, but there is very little emotional reaction. We know that these things are dangerous, but we donâ€™t feel threatened. Security trainers need to help people feel the danger, not merely think about it...*

*So the question remains, how do we evoke the healthy emotional responses that motivate adult human beings to protect themselves against dangers that they were not warned about as children? Merely describing the threat in an abstract way is unlikely to be effective. Rather, we need to emphasize the human impact of the threat and its relevance to the individual. This is most easily accomplished by telling stories!*"- _The Psychological Underpinnings of Security Training_ [^psych_sec_training]

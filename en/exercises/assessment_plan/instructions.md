Auditors are encouraged to use, or at least reference, the [SAFETAG Agreement Generator](https://github.com/SAFETAG/safetag_agreement_generator), a python script which provides a decision tree covering the above points, and builds a basic, clear-language agreement which can be translated and formalized as needed. Sample outputs and a diagram of the full decision tree are available in the "outputs" folder of the Agreement Generator repository. This replaces the draft agreement previously part of SAFETAG.

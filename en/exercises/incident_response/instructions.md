What counts as an incident should be agreed with the organization's management during the agreement phase, and should include possibilities informed by the Context and Technical Research work.

Incidents can include problems such as insider threats, active remote access malware systems, or the discovery of physical surveillance of the office, as well as many other possibilities.  The auditor must use their best judgement along the SAFETAG Auditor Code of Conduct, their agreement with the organization, personal ethics, legal reponsibilities, and balance this in the frame of the organization's context, capacity, and the need to in good faith gain the trust of the staff of the organization to fulfill a successful audit.

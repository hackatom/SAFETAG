* This exercise should be conducted if the Context Research, initial interview process, or other warning signs indicate that the organization may be facing targeted digital attacks.
* Conduct surveys, internviews, or discussions with individuals and with the organiztion staff a group. Depending on the sensitivity, you may find it easier to conduct these more informally throughout the audit duration. See Considerations for further discussion.
* Review findings and potentially repeat or follow up on specific incidents with different staff members
* Remember that the role of Tte auditor is not to fix or investigate the issue, but to collect data and pull out insights that will shape the audit.
* Be aware of time and don't spend too much time on explaining what advanced threats are
* Before starting the interview process, read about known or common attacks you can reference (DDoS attacks, malware, phishing, ransomware, etc.) to remind staff and get the conversation started. In order for the stories to be compelling, they should be localised and the threats should reflect common challenges in their line of work. Much of this can come from your technical context research work.

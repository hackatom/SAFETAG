This activity helps to identify the processes that allow the organization to function (publishing articles, payments, communicating with sources, field work etc) the assets and systems (websites, software, PayPal accounts) they rely on, and which ones are critical to their work.

Participating organization/s are asked to "brain-storm" a list of all the processes that are critical for their work and the auditor works to map the details of critical processes out to expose points of risk.

If done correctly, process mapping can help the auditor
	- Identify risk exposure
	- Communication issues and effective incident response
	- Identify what are affected (people, systems, technologies)
	- Identify areas of improvement in securing organization's process
	- Generate a mitigation/solution plan for missing security controls
	- Show the importance of digital security to staff, management team and stakeholders

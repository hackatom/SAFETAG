If the organization staff has received suspicious communications, the first step should be to clearly warn the auditee that any associated files or links *should not be opened*.

* Ask the client to share the complete email with you. Instructions on how to share the complete email, which includes full headers and attachments:

    Instructions: https://www.circl.lu/pub/tr-34/ (this is preferred over just asking for the headers - as described here: https://www.circl.lu/pub/tr-07/ - since it is just as complicated from the user prospective but provides more information to us or a malware researcher).

* Investigate the intent of the message. If this email appears to be spam, you can rule out an advanced threat and include in your recommendations instructions on how to report spam or mark email messages as junk.

* If the message does not seem to be spam and has links or files attached to the email, capture any suspicious URL and save the file in an empty storage device for further analysis.

* If the email does not have links or files and is not spam, investigate it as a potential social engineering email.

This exercise supports the auditor in building an effective dictionary that is customized to an organization.

This dictionary can then be used in a variety of ways:

* By using the examples referenced in the [WPA Password Cracking](#wpa-password-cracking) exercise, the auditor can attack weak wifi passwords, which present a non-personal and non-disruptive way to demonstrate password security problems.  Weak wifi passwords are specifically a challenge, as wifi signals often are accessible outside of an office's physical limits, but provide full access to the private network.
* An Auditor can show or discuss their preferred customization strategy and the tools (like JtR) that automatically "mutate" passwords with numbers, capitals, and so on, to demnonstrate the power of a computer to quickly get around common "tricks"
* An Auditor can also use a password "survey" to get an understanding of password practices within the organization.

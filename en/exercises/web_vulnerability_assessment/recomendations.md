Core recommendations are to always use well-supported, open source tools, and to minimize the use of interactive sites if not actually necessary. Removal of unused tools, demos, and default systems is highly encouraged.

For interactive sites, content management systems and other frameworks, make sure the site is actively maintained, updated to the latest software and security patches regularly, and that the user permissions are reviewed periodically.

Many automated scanning and reporting tools provide results of security problems it finds with differing levels of severity (https://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/wiki/HelpStartConceptsAlerts). Make special note of "High" severity issues and research the vulnerability and and recommendations suggested.

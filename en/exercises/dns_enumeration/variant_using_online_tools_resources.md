Using 3rd party and online tools can help an auditor/tester in avoiding his/her machine to generate logs on the target's end. In cases where the target, or partner organization who requests for an audit/assessment has some security devices in place (IDS/IPS, Firewall etc.) Generating logs from your machine/network may result sometimes in our traffic getting blocked due to "automatic blocking" features in these security devices/appliances.

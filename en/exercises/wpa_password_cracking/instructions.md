An attacker can crack the office’s WPA key in approximately with a short and minimally customized password dictionary based on open information about the organization and basic word collections.

**Step 1:** The attacker customizes their WiFi password dictionary, adding phrases related to the subject: organization name, street address, phone number, email domain, wireless network name, etc. Common password fragments are included, as well: qwerty, 12345, asdf and all four-digit dates back to the year 2001, for example, among others. The attacker may then add hundreds or thousands of words (in English and/or other relevant languages).

See the Password Strength exercise for details on password dictionary buidling and usage.

**Step 2:** The attacker would then begin recording all (encrypted) wireless traffic associated with the organization’s access point:

```
$ sudo airodump-ng -c 1 --bssid 1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F -w sampleorg_airodump mon0

 CH  1 ][ Elapsed: 12 mins ][ 2012-01-23 12:34 ][ fixed channel mon0: -1

 1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F  AB:CD:EF:AB:CD:EF    0    1e- 1      0     1234
 1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F  AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF  -76    0e- 1      0     1122

```

wifite is also useful for this step, and claims to automatically de-auth (step 3).

**Step 3:** Next, the auditor forces a wireless client, possibly chosen at random, to disconnect and reconnect (an operation that is nearly always invisible to the user).

In the example below, AB:CD:EF:AB:CD:EF is the MAC address of a laptop that was briefly disconnected in this way.

```
$ aireplay-ng -0 1 -a 1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F -c AB:CD:EF:AB:CD:EF mon0

 15:54:48  Waiting for beacon frame (BSSID: 1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F) on channel -1
 15:54:49  Sending 64 directed DeAuth. STMAC: [AB:CD:EF:AB:CD:EF] [ 5| 3 ACKs]
```

The goal of this step is to capture the cryptographic handshake that occurs when the targeted client reconnects. Try using different clients if the first one doesn't work, or try (physically) moving around.

This handshake does not contain the WPA key itself, but once the the complete handshake process has been seen, the auditor (or a potential attacker) can leave the vicinity and run various password cracking tools to try and discover the password. While a complete password cracking tutorial is out of scope for SAFETAG documentation, below are three strategies:

**Step 4:** The auditor attempts to discover the WPA password.

A good wordlist with a few tweaks tends to break an unforunate number of passwords.  Using a collection of all english words, all words from the language of the organization being audited, plus a combination of all these words, plus relevant keywords, addresses, and years tends to crack most wifi passwords.

```bash
    $ aircrack-ng -w pwdpairs.txt -b 1A:2B:3C:4D:5E:6F sampleorg_airodump*.cap
```

For WPA captures, John can either feed in to an aircrack process or attack a capture directly.  For captures, you first have to convert the .cap file (from wireshark, wifite, airodump, etc.) to a format that John likes.  The Jumbo version we use has conversion tools for this available:

```bash
  $wpapcap2john wpa.cap > crackme
  $./john -w:password.lst -fo=wpapsk-cuda crackme
```

The fourth line of the above output provides some useful information about the effectiveness of a strong WPA key. That rate of approximately 2000 keys per second means that a full-on, brute-force attack against a similar-length key that was truly random (and therefore immune to dictionary-based attacks) would take about 70^9 or 20 trillion seconds, which is well over 600,000 years. Or, for those who favor length and simplicity over brevity and complexity, a key containing four words chosen from among the 10,000 most common English dictionary words would still take approximately 150,000 years to crack (using this method on an average laptop).

It is worth noting that an attacker with the resources and the expertise could increase this rate by a factor of a hundred. Using a computer with powerful graphical processing units (GPUs) or a cloud computing service like Amazon’s EC2, it is possible to test 250,000 or more keys per second. A setup like this would still take several lifetimes to guess a strong password, however.

Regardless, the success of this attack against a wireless network would allow an attacker to bypass all perimeter controls, including the network firewall. Without access to the office LAN, a non-ISP, non-government attacker would have to position himself on the same network as an external staff member in order to exploit any flaws in the organization’s email or file-sharing services. With access to the local network, however, that attacker could begin carrying out Local attacks quite quickly, and from a distance.

With regard to the distance from which an attacker could maintain such access, the office WiFi network appears to have a relatively strong signal, which extends to the street out front:

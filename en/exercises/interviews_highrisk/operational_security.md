**Operational Security**

* In case you do an interview online, the data needs to be protected (end to end encryption, tor, vpns, etc)
* Get the consent of the participant to speak with them over that channel, or add details about the VOIP application and privacy information to the agreement
* Might consider not having the conversation in the office, but somewhere trusted
* Might want to leave devices outside of the room

**Psychological Considerations**

* Ask the staff to keep the stories generalised, not personalised during the organisation interview
* Staff might be embarrassed talk an incident about in front of the entire org
* Staff might exaggerate or overestimate attacks due to lack of understanding of the attack and impact
* Staff might underestimate attacks due to overexposure to these hacks, other pressing challenges, or lack of understanding
* Auditors should listen and explain concepts, but don't argue about the "seriousness" of the incident
* Don't correct the staff member if they describe the incident incorrectly
* Tread carefully, given the topic can be triggering or difficult and this is an early stage of the audit

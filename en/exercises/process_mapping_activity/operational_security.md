  - Ensure that any digital recordings of this process are kept secure, encrypted, and backed up
  - Consider who has physical and visual access to the room where this process takes place, and if the room can be secured if this activity may span long/overnight breaks.
  - For high-risk organizations, or even among others, it is of best practice to keep digital devices such as mobile phones, laptops and computers turned off during the mapping activity. The use of camera, (not camera phones) is recommended. Mobile devices such as laptops and mobile phones if compromised can record audio, and capture videos.

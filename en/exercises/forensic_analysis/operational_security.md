* If you have not analyzed malware before, do not start with real, live, and potentially targeted malware. See the References section from the Advanced Threat method for opportunities to build your skills without putting the organization or yourself at additional risk. 
* Any analysis must be done with extreme caution (using a dedicated system, carefully managed VM, with very limited/monitored if any network access)
* Continue to follow the Chain of Custody procedures described in the Evidence Capture activity
* Follow the procedures for logging and hashing described in the walkthrough

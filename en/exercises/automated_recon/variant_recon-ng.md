**Installing Recon-ng**

  * Install recon-ng from the git source: git clone https://LaNMaSteR53@bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng.git
  * cd recon-ng
  * Install pip (sudo apt-get install python-pip) and dependencies: pip install -r REQUIREMENTS
  * Launch Recon-ng: ./recon-ng

For full instructions, see the [Recon-ng Getting Started Instructions](https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng/wiki/Usage%20Guide#!getting-started)

**Using Recon-ng**

  * Read the short [Recon-ng Usage Guide](https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng/wiki/Usage%20Guide)

NOTE: This guide is based upon the data flow documentation from the [Recon-ng website](https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng/overview)

  * Interface Basics

By pressing tab twice you can use auto-completion.

```
[recon-ng][default] >
add         exit        load        record      search      show        use
back        help        pdb         reload      set         spool       workspaces
del         keys        query       resource    shell       unset
```

This works even in commands.

```
[recon-ng][default] > show
banner           credentials      hosts            locations        options          schema
companies        dashboard        keys             modules          ports            vulnerabilities
contacts         domains          leaks            netblocks        pushpins         workspaces
```

Using recon modules

The recon modules are named in a very specific fashion to help the user understand the flow of data inside the tool. Modules use the syntax ```<methodology step>/<input table>-<output table>/<module>```.   The inputs are the first part of each module, and the outputs are the second part.  The module name itself is the tool used to process the data.  So, recon/domains-hosts/brute-hosts takes domain names (websitename.org) as an input, and outputs hostnames (extranet.websitename.org, etc.).  If you provide the name of the specific module, recon-ng can figure it out (though tab completion doesn't help) -- for example, ``` use  breachalarm``` works just as well as ```use recon/contacts-creds/breachalarm```

You can also search modules by their inputs or outputs. ```search domains-``` displays all modules that take domain names as their input, and ```search -contacts``` displays all modules that outputs contact information.

**Preparing**

Set verboseness on during the guide so that you can see everything that happens. (recommended to begin with)

```
[recon-ng][default] > set VERBOSE True
```

  * Add API Keys

You can use auto completion to see all the possible keys you can add.

```
[recon-ng][websitename] > keys add
bing_api           facebook_secret    google_cse         jigsaw_username    pwnedlist_iv       twitter_api
builtwith_api      facebook_username  ipinfodb_api       linkedin_api       pwnedlist_secret   twitter_secret
facebook_api       flickr_api         jigsaw_api         linkedin_secret    shodan_api         virustotal_api
facebook_password  google_api         jigsaw_password    pwnedlist_api      sonar_api
```

Choose and add a key.

```
[recon-ng][default] > keys add bing_api TYPE_THE_KEY_VALUE_HERE
[*] Key 'bing_api' added.
```

You can list keys by using the command ```keys list``` Reference the Creating API Keys Section below for quick links to setting up popular APIs.


**First steps**

NOTE: This walkthrough is using sample data. Results will vary widely depending on the organization you are working with.

  * Create a workspace for your recon.

```
[recon-ng][default] > workspaces add websitename
[recon-ng][websitename] >
```

  * Note that you can also switch workspaces during the recon.

```
[recon-ng][websitename] > workspaces select default
[recon-ng][default] >
[recon-ng][default] > workspaces select websitename
[recon-ng][websitename] >
```


  * Add known seed information (domains, netblocks, company names, locations, etc.)

Display possible seed information by using auto-completion.

```
[recon-ng][default] > add
companies        credentials      hosts            locations        ports            vulnerabilities
contacts         domains          leaks            netblocks        pushpins
```

We will only use the organization's name, one domain, two netblocks (that we got by searching for other domains and ping-ing them), and two e-mails of the company we are looking for so we will add those.

First, add the company name.

```
[recon-ng][websitename] > add companies
company (TEXT): Websitename
description (TEXT):
```

Next, add the domain.

```
[recon-ng][default] > add domains websitename.org
[recon-ng][websitename] > show domains

  +--------------------------------+
  | rowid |     domain    | module |
  +--------------------------------+
  | 1     | websitename.org | base   |
  +--------------------------------+

[*] 1 rows returned
```

Next, add my contacts. we don't know much. But, we will add what we know.

```
[recon-ng][websitename] > add contacts
first_name (TEXT): Bob
middle_name (TEXT):
last_name (TEXT): Smith
email (TEXT): bsmith@websitename.org
title (TEXT):
region (TEXT):
country (TEXT): USA
[recon-ng][websitename] > add contacts
first_name (TEXT): Carl
middle_name (TEXT):
last_name (TEXT): Johnson
email (TEXT): cjohnson@websitename.org
title (TEXT):
region (TEXT):
country (TEXT): USA
[recon-ng][websitename] >
```

Finally we will add the ip address of their website.

```
[recon-ng][websitename] > add netblocks
netblock (TEXT): 174.154.167.69
[recon-ng][websitename] > add netblocks
netblock (TEXT): 96.127.170.121
```

Here it is in the database.

```
[recon-ng][websitename][shodan_net] > show netblocks

  +---------------------------------+
  | rowid |    netblock    | module |
  +---------------------------------+
  | 2     | 174.154.167.69 | base   |
  | 3     | 96.127.170.121 | base   |
  +---------------------------------+
```

**Reconnaisance phase (netblocks example)**

  * Run modules that leverage known netblocks. This exposes other domains and hosts from which domains can be harvested.

First, search for any modules that use netblocks as an input.

```
recon-ng][websitename] > search netblocks-
[*] Searching for 'netblocks-'...

  Recon
  -----
    recon/netblocks-hosts/reverse_resolve
    recon/netblocks-hosts/shodan_net
    recon/netblocks-ports/census_2012
```


In the case of ```recon/netblocks-hosts/shodan_net``` we can see that the "shodan_net" module is a reconnaissance module that takes in netblocks and produces hosts.

Lets try it out...

```
[recon-ng][websitename] > use recon/netblocks-hosts/shodan_net
[recon-ng][websitename][shodan_net] >
```


An empty command line can be daunting. If you are ever stuck on what current commands you can use the help command to see the current commands.

```
[recon-ng][websitename][shodan_net] > help

```

Use the ```show info``` command to learn about the module and see what options are available.

```
[recon-ng][websitename][shodan_net] > show info

Since it promised me hosts, we will see what hosts it uncovered.

```
[recon-ng][websitename][shodan_net] > show hosts

It seems the website leillc.net is obviously not associated with the company I am doing recon on.
Since this module has finished, we will leave it using the ```back``` command.

```
[recon-ng][websitename][shodan_net] > back
[recon-ng][websitename] >
```

Now we will use the other two ```netblock-``` modules. We will show one more and then skip the second.

First we find all the possible modules using tab completion.

```
[recon-ng][websitename] > use recon/netblocks-
recon/netblocks-hosts/reverse_resolve  recon/netblocks-hosts/shodan_net       recon/netblocks-ports/census_2012
[recon-ng][websitename] > use recon/netblocks-
```

We are going to use reverse-resolve.

```
[recon-ng][websitename][census_2012] > use recon/netblocks-hosts/reverse_resolve
```

But, when we run it we get an error!

```
[recon-ng][websitename][reverse_resolve] > run
174.154.167.69
[!] Need more than 1 value to unpack.
```

OPTIONAL: To figure out what was going on, go ```back``` and then ```set DEBUG True``` to see the underlying error. The debug error message lets us know that we need to use full netmask syntax for netblocks. We will now add new netblocks in the correct format and then delete the old ones.

First we will add them correctly.

```
[recon-ng][websitename][reverse_resolve] > add netblocks
netblock (TEXT): 177.154.167.69/72
[recon-ng][websitename][reverse_resolve] > add netblocks
netblock (TEXT): 96.127.170.121/72
```

Now we have double of the same netblocks

```
[recon-ng][websitename][reverse_resolve] > show netblocks

  +---------------------------------------------+
  | rowid |      netblock     |      module     |
  +---------------------------------------------+
  | 2     | 174.154.167.69    | base            |
  | 4     | 177.154.167.69/72 | reverse_resolve |
  | 3     | 96.127.170.121    | base            |
  | 5     | 96.127.170.121/72 | reverse_resolve |
  +---------------------------------------------+

[*] 4 rows returned
```

Now that we know their rowid numbers, I can delete them.
```
[recon-ng][websitename][reverse_resolve] > del netblocks
rowid(s) (INT): 2
[recon-ng][websitename][reverse_resolve] > del netblocks
rowid(s) (INT): 3
```

And, re-running the module now works.

```
[recon-ng][websitename][reverse_resolve] > run

[*] 96.127.170.121 => vps.websitename.org

SUMMARY

[*] 2 total (1 new) items found.
```

Now, exploring these hosts we realize quickly that most the new hosts on other domains are not associated with the company. Hence, we will remove them.

```
[recon-ng][websitename] > show hosts

We skip the last module ```recon/netblocks-ports/census_2012``` since you already get the idea.

  * Add new domains gleaned from the results if they have not automatically been added.

Sadly, none of the new domains were actually useful.

  * Run modules that conduct DNS brute forcing of TLDs and SLDs against current domains.

Let's find new domains using brute forcing. First we should look for what is available.

```
[recon-ng][websitename] > search domains-domains

This returned quite a few domains. We have removed the middle section

```

  * Have list of domains validated by the client.
  * Remove out-of-scope domains with the "del" command or generate a query which only selects the scoped domains as input.

Many out of scope domains had to be removed, but luckily you can specify ranges when you delete.

```
[recon-ng][websitename][brute_suffix] > del domains
rowid(s) (INT): 72-44
```

  * Run modules that conduct DNS brute forcing of hosts against all domains.

There are a lot of these, so we will only run one since there is little to nothing new to learn here.

**If Unsupported Operating System - Upgrade to Recent Version**

Popular operating systems like Windows XP are, sadly, no longer receiving security updates. Upgrade to the latest version keeping in mind the system requirements of the version selected. For Windows, review the [Windows lifecycle fact sheet](https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet) for upcoming "EOLs" (End of Life). Apple does not publish EOL schedules, but historically releases security updates for their current and two prior releases. 

While "pirated" operating systems and software are extremely common (especially for Windows) they often leave much to be desired in terms of security.  If the OS or Software is not receiving regular updates from the software creator, it is extremely vulnerable to thousands of potential attacks. Switch to licensed software or recommended Free Open Source Software

**If Pirated Software - Move to Licensed Software Systems**

**If Outdated - Update Operating Systems and Other Software**

Operating Systems and Softwares of all varieties - Windows, Mac, Linux, and others, are constantly being updated.  These updates often fix bugs, but they also protect the system from newly discovered vulnerabilities.  It can seem difficult to keep updating constantly, but this is very important to protect even non-sensitive systems.

**If Vulnerable Software - Update Vulnerable Software**

Many critical software components, such as Java or Adobe Flash, have many vulnerabilities and need to be aggressively updated. If there are not needed for work by the users, uninstall them

**If No Anti-Virus and Anti-Malware Scanner - Install Anti-Virus and Anti-Maware Scanner**

An Anti-virus and Anti-malware offer some minimal protection to the system and therefore is important to have them installed.

**If Outdated Anti-Virus - Update Anti-Virus**

Most AV tools automatically update, but this can sometimes get out of sync, or if the AV was a pre-installed trial system, it will stop updating after its trial period.  An out of date anti-virus is worthless. Therefore ensure that continuous udpdating of AV is done.

**If Unencrypted Drive  - Encrypt Hard Drives**

When possible, build-in drive encryption (Filevault on OSX, BitLockeron Windows, and LUKS on Linux) tend to offer the most seamless, user-friendly experiences. VeraCrypt offers free cross-platform drive encryption and cna also create encrypted drives which can be shared across platforms.

**If Inactive firewall - Activate both personal and server firewall (If present)**

Again, where present, use built-in firewalls and configure them for both office and public network options. Testing to ensure systems can still perform expected office natworking (file sharing, printing, etc.) is essential unless alternatives are created.

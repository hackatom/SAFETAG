Mapping an organization's network exposes the multitude of devices connected to it -- including mostly forgotten servers -- and provides the baseline for later work on device assessment and vulnerability research.

This process also reveals outside service usage (such as google services, dropbox, or others) which serve -- intentionally or not -- as shadow infrastructure for the organization. In combination with beacon research from the *Monitor Open Wireless Traffic* exercise, many devices can be associated with users.

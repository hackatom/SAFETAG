Before unleashing more advanced and powerful tools like OpenVAS, a few quick steps can help better guide your work. As a general note, surfing using a browser with at least [NoScript](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/) enabled may help not only protect you, but may also help to reveal malware or adware infecting the websites.

Record core details about the website - determine the hosting provider, platform, Content Management Systems, and other baseline data.  [BuiltWith](http://builtwith.com/) is a great tool.  There are a few alternatives, including an open source tool, [SiteLab](https://callmeed.github.io/site-lab/).  *Note that BuiltWith is a tool bundled in recon-ng, but the output it provides is not currently stored in its data structures.* These tools may also reveal plugins, javascript libraries, and DDoS protection systems like CloudFlare.

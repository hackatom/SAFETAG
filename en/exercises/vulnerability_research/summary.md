Part of the SAFETAG framework is vulnerability research. This refers to process of reviewing and validating each vulnerabilities or issues that you will discovery during the audit period.

This exercise requires auditors to review each of the vulnerabilities found during the audit. 
From verifying that the vulnerability exists on the organization's premise or device, looking up to online vulnerability databases to know more about the details of the vulnerability (e.g. affected products, versions or certain module etc.), how can it be exploited (e.g. remote code execution, system crash, information leak etc.) and lastly, reading through  recommendations on how to fix such vulnerabilities.

Adapt this survey to get a sense of how passwords are used in the organization.  Anonymous paper surveys, later destroyed, are a good way to gather this information. The earlier questions are more important in terms of getting a sense of password practices, so consider adapting or shortening the survey based on staff/leadership buy-in and risk considerations.

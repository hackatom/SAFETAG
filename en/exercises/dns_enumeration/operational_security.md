* When performing "active enumeration" it is always good to ask to whitelisting your IPs whenever you perform assessments. This rules out the idea of attackers having able to avoid shunning. Whitelisting your IPs also removes false positive reports and inaccurate results
* It is important that we verify that we have the correct target domain(s) before proceeding with any of the scans/audits/assessments exercises within SAFETAG Framework. The last thing we wouldn't want to happen is to scan and enumerate target which is out of scope!)

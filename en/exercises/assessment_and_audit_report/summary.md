Creating a good and easily understood report is one of the challenges in a digital security audit and assessment. With making the organization, stakeholders staff and managers understand the risks involved whenever a security control is missing as the goal in mind, our audit report must be accurate and precise. Putting your technical skills into a readable format can be a daunting task to some, since not everyone is a fan of documentation.

"*The assessment should be relevant to the situation of the NGO locally and should therefore avoid diversions on factors which have no implications for NGO safety and security. This step is the part of the process that supports and allows the identification of general and specific threats to the NGO operation. All data collected must be relevant to safety and security of the activities which the NGO is conducting, supported as much as possible by facts and relevant deductions, and up to date.*" - _Security Risk Management: NGO Approach_ [^interaction_security_risk_management]

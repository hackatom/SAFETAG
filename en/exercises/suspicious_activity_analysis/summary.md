Malware is a common tactic to target organizations. Malware like a Remote Access Trojan (or RAT) can provide an attacker with backdoor access to a targeted machine, enabling the attacker to steal information, record audio and video, as well as run commands on the infected machine.

To stop this from happening, you have to identify the malicious process within the system and stop it, or reformatting the machine in case you don’t feel spending time on stopping the malicious process.

It’s important to keep evidence, in case the auditee still has access to the original malicious software they received (e.g., an email, etc.), keep a copy of the file if you have the time and expertise to continue investigating or have the resources to submit it to other organizations working on analyzing such issues.

Scanning the possible infected machine or the original suspicious file with an anti-virus will save you time and effort, in the case such malware is already in its database. Scanning should always be the first step, preventing you from spending excess time if the machine was infected with a less serious piece of malware.

After determining the machine is infected, you can proceed in helping the staff member back up their information, scanning the files for malware, then reformatting the infected machine. Note, it is very difficult to clean an infected machine if you only have a short window of time.

In case the machine was infected, taking an image of the operating system will allow you to replicate the infected machine and run it after you finish your audit for a more in-depth investigation or send it to an expert to work on investigating the malware. Note, this also can be difficult in an audit setting where time is limited. Also see operational security considerations that come with replicating the files of a staff member of a sensitive organization. Be sure this is absolutely necessary and the staff members provides consent before completing.

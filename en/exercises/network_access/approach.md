  * Determine the security of the wireless access point (WAP).
  * Gain access to the organizations Wireless network access.
  * Test unused ethernet ports for live network connectivity.
  * Find out how guest access is managed

*Note*:
Cracking wireless passwords often take a huge amount of time performing, and the same results for the audit and organizational buy-in can be had simply by showing how password cracking works, and how far outside of the office the wireless network can be seen. Once an organization is using vulnerable authentication method, you can flag it right away as "finding". Given that the recommendations are often the same (move to WPA2 (and WPA3 as available), disable WEP and WPS access, provide a separate guest network, etc.), this should rarely be used during an audit (but is a useful skill to practice and understand how it works). If you do choose to use this during an audit, be aware that many of the stps disrupt network traffic, and success with WPA2 password cracking is by no means guaranteed, so can backfire.

* Understand the current infrastructure the website is using on the level of the hosting provider, location, Operating system
* Identify the public IP address of the server you will be auditing as you will see in somecases, websites are using proxies or DDoS mitigation services that mask the real IP address of a server
* In the case of shared hosting, identify the hosting service and the current package 
* Identify the web server, applications in use & plugins, themes, security protocols in place and users' session management
* Identify misconfigurations, sensitive information publicly available, metadata embedded within the web application
* Look for forgotten or insecure support applications like /phpmyadmin   
* Run automated vulnerability scans against websites hosted by the organization to identify "low-hanging fruits" especially in the case of auditing an opensource and common content management system or other web applications  
* Perform manual vulenrability asessment and testing to identify server misconfigurations, web sessions, tokens etc.

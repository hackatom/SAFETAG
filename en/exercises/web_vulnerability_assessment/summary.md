Organizational websites are often a central part of their work, but resource constraints can leave them vulnerable to a wide variety of attacks, from simple DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks to being leveraged for online scams and malicious advertisin to targeted distruction and subversion. Insecure websites can even be used in "watering hole" attacks where malware is implanted into the site to intentionally target the website's audience.

This activity provides a SAFETAG auditor with a suite of processes and tools to investigate organization and project websites for potential vulnerabilities.  There are multiple ways to do this, from passive to more active scanning. SAFETAG takes great care to take a primarily passive approach to this work, especially when done off-site, so as not to have unintended consequences on the organization's infrastructure or undermine operational security concerns. Care should be taken to review operational security concerns, work closely with the organization, and pursue a minimal approach focused on the priorities of the organization. See also the Vulnerability Scanning activity for additional tools and approaches useful for investigating outside of the website itself the server level.

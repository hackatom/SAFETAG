#### Activity Title

##### Summary

*What does this specific activity accomplish?*

##### Overview

*A short, bulleted list that clarifies the general steps, especially for cases where the walkthrough is very complex or involves multiple or parallel processes.  Also included when only referencing an exercise from a method, instead of including the full exercise.* 

##### Materials Needed 

*Optional; does this require specific software, hardware, or preparation?*

##### Considerations

*Optional; Notes on safely carrying out the activity and protecting the data collected, as well as other challenges (psycho-social, legal, ethical) to be aware of -- Are there operational security concerns, or important baseline skills to master before undertaking this activity?*

##### Walkthrough

*A multi-use guide with concise instructions for a skilled technologist to replicate or prove the vulnerability.  This is used in the SAFETAG curricula, by auditors needing to recall that random flag for that one command without going online, and for the organization's technical staff to verify that this vulnerability has been addressed. This should provide concise guidance at a peer level for the general steps an auditor should take, but should point to, not re-create existing documentation. For technical aspects, ideal walkthroughs should enable IT staff/contractors to follow along and verify fixes. For research activities, research methods and preferred resources should be provided, and for facilitative exercises, a clear explanation of the process and any tips or challenges should be explained*
 
*Note: For activities where multiple different approaches could fulfill the exact same goals, activity variants are being explored, see https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/issues/315 for detail.*

##### Recommendation

*Optional; Sample text of common recommendations for how to address vulnerabilities identified through this activity; e.g. "Work with the webmaster to update PHP and/or migrate to a hosting system which manages this automatically...") -- for activities which have common findings, provide stock language to assist in report creation*

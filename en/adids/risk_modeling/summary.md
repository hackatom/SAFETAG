### Summary

The risk modeling exercises are a central part of the SAFETAG audit process.  They most importantly create buy-in for later recommendations, as the auditor adjusts their reporting to fit the organization's prioritization of risks from this step.  It also introduces a way of approaching processes in an organization from a more security-focused point of view. 

It is an intense process which requires approximately half a day to go through, but it can be split across multiple shorter sessions.

Obviously the information generated through this is of a highly sensitive nature, as it essentially builds a map of the organization's most vulnerable and most critical processes.

SAFETAG uses a specific series of exercises, but these are not prescriptive:

 1) Critical process mapping
 2) Identify threats to those processes and the impact if those threats occur
 3) Impact and Likelihood Ranking

Spear Phishing (targeted phishing) is a a phishing attack against specific organization or an individual. Unlike mass phishing where the attacker sends the payload to multiple user, in spear phishing the payload is sent only to the target user or organization.

In this exercise, you will present a demonstration to your audience how phishing attack works:

  - Use a 3rd party email provider to send out malicious email and confirm verify activity from the target
  - You will learn how to use Kali's metasploit console to deploy a custom malware for your demonstration
  - Install virtualized Windows target (The machine that will click "that" link, and is usually an old version of Windows)

Aside from these, you will learn some of the exploits available in Metasploit that we will use for the demo:
  - Malicious pdf file (for certain vulnerable version of adobe)
  - Malicious link (for a certain version of internet explorer)
  - Malicious multimedia file (for a certain version of VLC that is vulnerable)

It's very common to find critical findings during a SAFETAG audit. Organizations are mostly unaware of these incidents thus requires us to act immediately specially in cases of compromise. (malware, surveillance, hacked web servers etc.)

The following items provides a starter whenever preparing for an audit and incorporating an incident response plan.

 * Establish what severity counts as an "incident" for the organization
 * Agree on primary and secondary points of contact and relevant contact information
 * Agree on security protocols around incident response
 * Create procedure for incident handling in the event that auditor cause or uncover an incident during the course of the assessment. [^NIST_SP_800-115-Section_7.1]^,^[^pets_emergency_contact_info]

A good framework to follow during this stage is the P.I.C.E.R.L framework:

	P - Preparation
	I - Identification
	C - Containment
	E - Eradication
	R - Recovery
	L - Lessons learned

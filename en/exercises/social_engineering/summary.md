Social engineering is considered one of the most effective way to break the security chain of an organization. This is because it targets the human weakness which is lack of security awareness and human emotion. 

Social engineering assessment helps auditor gauge the organization along with it's staff and members it's security awareness and it's policy and procedures. 

Social engineering attacks comes in different types. Some of the most common are:

  - Email 
  - Phone calls
  - SMS
  - Office walk-in
 
Social engineering exercise if will be included in the vulnerability assessment and penetration testing, should be clearly stated, along with the type of attack to be performed. This clears the auditor/tester of the complications of performing social engineering tests, as it may reveal sensitive information which when not handled properly may become a risk both for the auditor and the auditee. (e.g., credentials for social media, email and other online accounts of the target organization). 

If the organization agreed to social engineering you may start setting up your environment depending on the types of attacks you have both approved.

The end goal of this exercise is to let the staff take part in activities to explore what phishing look like based on sample "phishing campaign" style emails sent by the auditor as examples. The auditor and staff will discuss the consequences of having their devices compromised.

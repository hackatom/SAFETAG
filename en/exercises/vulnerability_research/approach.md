There's a handful of resources that can help you in performing vulnerability research. Though not all can be useful, a good understanding of common terms about vulnerabilities, threats and exploits is important. 

If you're a new auditor or someone who is not yet familiar with the terms (e.g. XSS, Remote code execution, heap spray attack etc) It is advisable to read through it's definition.

A good article about these terms can be found [here](https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/vulnerabilities-exploits-threats)

According to Wikipedia's definition of [vulnerability in computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing))
A vulnerability is classified according to the asset class they are related to:

	- Hardware (Router, printer etc)
		- Susceptibility to physical damage
		- Susceptibility to unauthorized access
		- Susceptibility to theft

	- Software
		- Product specific (e.g. outdated version & releases)
		- Default configurations (e.g. Usernames, passwords and settings)
		- Insecure added modules/plugins 

	- Network
		- Unprotected communication lines (e.g. HTTP access)
		- Insecure network architecture (e.g. default to weak wifi passwords)

	- Personnel
		- Inadequate recruiting process
		- Inadequate security awareness

	- Physical site/location
		- Area subject to calamity/disaster (e.g. flood)
		- unreliable resources (e.g. electricity, internet connection)
		- Phyiscal security (e.g. door locks, partition walls, CCTV)
		- lack of continuity plans (e.g. backup storage)
		- lack of security (e.g. glass doors & partitions)

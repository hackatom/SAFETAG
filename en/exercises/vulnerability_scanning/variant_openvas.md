**Using OpenVAS**

Once logged in to OpenVAS, the interface is disturbingly simple to use.  For most use, using the Wizard to scan the target server works best.  Things to verify before doing so:

* Check the Scan defaults for the Wizard - it should be set to run the built-in "Full and Fast" scan
* For that scan, verify (under Configuration->Scan Configs) that the "Scan Settings" list shows "safe_checks" as "yes"

Once you start a scan, change the display to "auto refresh" to give you more feedback on the scan process. Once the scan is completed, a report can be exported in PDF form.

**Common problems**
* **Errors during openvas-start** OpenVAS is a rather ... delicate program. Most often, the openvas-start script will not wait long enough between launching openvassd and openvasmd, causing openvasmd to error out. Re-running openvasmd often works, though an entire stop/start cycle seems to be slightly more reliable.  Often, openvasmd will error out, but launch anyway.  Checking the web interface at https://127.0.0.1:9392 to make sure that you can log in is the best way to check if it's actually successfully launched.
* **Lost admin password** From a root command-line, you can reset the web interface's admin password:
```
openvasmd --create-user=admin
openvasmd --user=admin --new-password=admin
```
* **openvasmd will never launch** In many fresh install cases of OpenVAS7, the openVAS self-signed CA certificate is set to an invalid date, which also causes openvasmd to error out. The check-setup script will recommend rebuilding the database, but the /var/log/openvas/openvasmd.log may have errors discussing certificate errors.  If this is the case, try:
```
rm /var/lib/openvas/CA/*
rm /var/lib/openvas/private/CA/*
openvas-mkcert
openvas-mkcert-client -n -i
openvas-check-setup
openvas-start
openvasmd --rebuild
openvas-stop
openvas-start
```

The auditor confirms the number and nature of mobile devices that the organization owns. The auditor should keep within the agreed scope. But in the case where multiple mobile devices outside the agreed scope access the organizations' resources, then redefining of the scope may be necessary. Auditor should also consider the instructions under the device checklist.

As you work with staff members, also remember to interview them about the devices they use. This can alternate between mobile devices and non-mobile devices.

Below are some guiding questions to use. And this is an opportunity for the auditor to go deeper into any area concerning devices.

Guiding questions:

* What categories of mobile devices does the organization have? (eg, laptops, phones, external drives, cameras, recording devices, etc)

* What are they primarily used for?

* What data is stored on the devices and who has access to them

* Are the devices provided by organization or do staff use personal devices for official work? (Auditor: Review the props and cons of each set up)

* What are the risks involved with using each of the mobile devices? (NB: Auditor should know at least 2 risk for each of the devices in use)

* What is the impact of their use to the organization's work?

* Does the organization have specific policies and procedures concerning mobile devices? (eg; policy on use, encryption, location services, access control, password standards, etc)

* If yes; Do the policies and procedures define the access level to organizational devices and also for personal devices?

* What is the policy on using untrusted networks?

* Which mobile phone OS are staff using? What are the props and cons of each?

* What are the users' perception towards the installed applications on their devices? (Auditor: Review the perception vs reality check findings)

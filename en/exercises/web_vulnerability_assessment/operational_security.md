* Begin with passive techniques and consider if more detail is necessary (e.g. would simply upgrading the CMS solve multiple problems). Remember that the point is to create a clear, simple path towards security, not a comprehensive report on every possible vulnerability
* Seek explicit permission for vulnerability scanning - *NOTE:*  The organization might not be in a position to give you meaningful “permission” to carry out an active remote assessment of "cloud services" used within the organization.
* Agree on the site(s) to scan and determine the intensity of the process
* Ensure documented permission and schedule an appropriate time with the site host.
* In situations where the auditor is doing this work remotely it is important to only run "safe" tests that have no possibility of causing damage to the website. Be very careful about which automated scans you run to ensure that no aggressive or potentially damaging tests are included.
* Understand, discover and review the backup options the website has before starting the audit process.

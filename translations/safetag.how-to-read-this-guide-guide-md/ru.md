#### Движение данных

The purpose of audit activities is to acquire risk assessment and mitigation information. As this information is acquired, earlier audit steps will have to be re-visited based upon updated information. The "Flow of Information" shows the types of information that an audit objective builds upon (input), and the types of information that it may reveal (outcomes).

#### Вопросы по теме

Each audit objective is guided by a small set of core questions. Key questions are included to help an auditor identify when they have acquired enough information and customize their approach while still collecting the correct types of information to support the organization.

## TITLE

### Summary

*A short - two to three sentence - basic overview of the methodology -- What is the auditor doing , what are the high-level outputs and processes?*

### Purpose

*The justification for why this methodology is used -- Why is this collection of activities being pursued? what is the end goal?*

### The Flow of Information

*The "Flow of Information" shows the types of information that an audit activity builds upon (input), and the types of information that an audit activity may reveal (outcomes). As this information is acquired, earlier audit will have to be re-visited based upon this information --  What are the inputs which feed in to this, and what outputs are possible/expected? Modify the Information Flow diagram in images/info_flows*

### Guiding Questions

*Each audit activity is guided by a small set of core questions. Key questions are included to help an auditor identify when they have acquired enough information and customize their approach while still collecting the correct types of information to support the organization -- What are specific guiding or research questions to be answered by conducting activities in pursuit of the larger goal?*

### Approaches

*Many of these audit activities can be completed in multiple ways depending upon auditor skill and the organizational technical setup and capacity. The approach section includes a descriptive, bulleted list of activities that can be used to carry out parts, or the whole, of the information collection for an audit activity. -- What are the high-level approaches to answering the guiding questions? Try to list different types of approaches - some might be technical, some research, some interactive*

### Outputs

*The data or impact is expected from this method -- What are specific outputs to aim for? These should further clarify the information flow diagram above.*

### Operational Security

*Operational Security considerations -- Does pursuing this objective have any broad operational security challenges to be aware of that is not otherwise captured in the per-activity detail?*

### Preparation

*Optional; Any preparation, skills, or materials needed for the method as a whole.  Individual exercises will specify this more exactly -- What must an auditor do to prepare for this work that is not otherwise captured in the per-activity detail?*

### Activities

*Specific activities to conduct in pursuit of this objective. See "Creating a New SAFETAG Activity" -- What existing activities are useful to achieve the goal and specific output(s) listed? Do they represent? If creating a new method, often new activities will be needed to ensure the suggested approaches are "filled in".  Please note that Activities are separate documents linked in to the Methods*

### Resources

*Resources should include not only the research used in the creation of the method, but also recommended reading, references, and additional options for conducting this work -- What references did you use in creating this method?  Are there references which provide activity style walkthroughs or additional backgrounds? Are there existing collections of references (in the references folder) that an auditor should review when looking at this methodology.*

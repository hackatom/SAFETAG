"*Many important issues in computer security involve users, designers, implementors, and managers. A broad range of security issues relate to how these individuals interact with computers and the access and authorities they need to do their job. No IT system can be secured without properly addressing these security issues.*" - _Generally Accepted Principles and Practices for Securing Information Technology Systems (NIST)_ [^NIST_800_14_user_issues]

OWASP ZAP allows an auditor to quickly identify common web vulnerabilities using the [OWASP framework](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page) - either by a relatively intense spidering of the website or through a more tailored use of the proxy functionality of the tool.

OWASP ZAP provides a highly configurable tool to test for common website vulnerabilities. In addition to supporting organizational change to support general best practices for websites, OWASP can expose more specific vulnerabilties that may warrant action above and beyond general best practice work.

For a website that can be expected to withstand a dedicated spidering of its content, the automated mode will dig through and expose common vulnerabilities. The tool itself is relatively easy to use.

For more delicate sites, private sites, or other situations, OWASP can also proxy your web browser and test the pages you click through.

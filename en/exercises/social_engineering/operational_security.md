Depending on the scope of your social engineering tests, it may reveal sensitive information that can put the organization or an individual at risk if proper preparation and security consideration is not performed.

Some of these information can be:

 - Usernames and login passwords
 - Account names and numbers
 - Wireless network passwords
 - Access to records (organizational, client, personal)

In preparation for your test, the following recommendations can be considered:

 - Use of custom exploits.
 
   Using custom exploits (malware, scripts, backdoors) in gathering information reqiures approval of the auditee. While some organization allows the use of custom exploits, this has to be non-disruptive. Other organization may not feel comfortable in using custom exploits. If this is your case, you may use alternative ways of verifying clicks, and logins. When using custom exploits, make sure that you have set them up with only you having access permission to them, along with the hosting website/server. 
   
 - Online and local attacks.
 
   Social engineering attacks can be perform locally, or over the web. This may vary with the level of skill of the auditor/tester. This may apply to certain test such as cloning a website, distribution of malicious file and link using phishing attacks. If using online redirects, you need to make sure that you own the site/server and that you are using secure connection. 
   
 - Phone calls, SMS and physical assessments.
 
   Phone call is one of the most common way to perform social engineering attack. With publicly available information that you have already gathered using data mining, you may start calling numbers or sending SMS with the questions you prepared for your target. If you are also performing physical attacks (e.g., visiting office and acting as employee), you need to bring with you signed documents in case you are questioned and your identity compromised.

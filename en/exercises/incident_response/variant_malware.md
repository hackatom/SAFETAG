For the implementation of mitigation measures, you can refer the auditees to a third party. This may be the organization's IT staff, a rapid response helpline, a malware researcher, etc.

Some of the mitigation steps can be implemented by the user, following the instructions included in the Rapid Response Network's [Digital First Aid Kit](https://rarenet.github.io/DFAK/en/Malware/).

You should consider a compromise serious and coordinate an incident response if any of the following is happening:

- files are being leaked
- you have detected a keylogger or spyware in a device
- the infected device is critical for the organization

Possible mitigation steps are below. *This step should not take more than 2 hours, and the auditor should coordinate the response, rather than carry it out themselves.* The auditor should keep in mind the organization's capacity and be extremely careful when reformatting devices, as there may be critical programs which the organization does not have the installation media / license keys for any more, or critical data on the disk which did not come up in other discussions. Check to see if the organization has trustworthy operating system installation media and license keys. In almost every situation, these mitigations should be done post-audit so as to ensure the audit itself has time to complete and be thorough.

- if the device is not critical, avoid using the infected device and disable its ability to access the network until a thorough investigation has been completed
- In consultation with the organization and any IT staff, delete the hard disk content and reinstall the system
- if the forensic capture of the whole hard disk would take too long, and an investigation is needed, the hard disk can be replaced (See the Advanced Threats Method for further guidance)
- if reinstalling the system is not possible, the device should be replaced
- mobile devices can be reset to factory settings. After resetting to factory settings, make sure any app or data recovery is not including potential compromise vectors, such as browser extensions, malicious applications, etc.
